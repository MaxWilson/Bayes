        <h3>Boring Explanation</h3> Bayes' Theorem says that P(H | Evidence) = P(Evidence | H) * P(H) / P(Evidence), where P(Evidence) is a normalization term that makes probabilities still sum to one.<br /><br />Before the election, Nate Silver computed that there was a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/final-election-update-theres-a-wide-range-of-outcomes-and-most-of-them-come-up-clinton/">71% chance of Hillary winning.</a> If H is the hypothesis that "538 is better than a coin flip for predicting election results", and Evidence is "Trump wins the election", then P(Evidence | H) = 0.29, P(Evidence) = P(Evidence | H) * P(H) + P(Evidence | not H) * P(not H), and P(H | Evidence) = 0.29 * P(H) / P(Evidence).
